# hotpotato LIA project

Result of a period where I was a mentor for a couple of students during their first [LIA period](https://www.myh.se/yrkeshogskolan/for-utbildningsanordare/larande-i-arbete-lia), the frontend stack they got to learn was SvelteKit and Storybook

## Installation and run

`pnpm install && pnpm dev` - dev server

`pnpm install && pnpm storybook` - storybook server
