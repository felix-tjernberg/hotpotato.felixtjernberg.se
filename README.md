# hotpotato LIA project

Result of a period where I was a mentor for a couple of students during their first [LIA period](https://www.myh.se/yrkeshogskolan/for-utbildningsanordare/larande-i-arbete-lia), the frontend stack they got to learn was SvelteKit and Storybook

We also tried out building the website from [a design](https://www.figma.com/file/3SSRNqJ5QqPoz9HSWsKdR9/Hot-potato?type=design&node-id=11%3A17&mode=design&t=qNbXjTFba56n2XNX-1) created using my UCCP design method

This was only a simple project and we took some shortcuts with design and code because of time constraints

## Installation and run

`pnpm install && pnpm dev` - dev server

`pnpm install && pnpm storybook` - storybook server
